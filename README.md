Hello Everyone. 

The purpose of this repo is to help people who may be struggling with problems on Leetcode. I am sure we all have different approaches to answering problems on the site, but some of us may get stuck for large periods of time and that hinders our learning. I hope that this can be one extra resource we can use when tackling problems as we learn to complete practice problems efficiently.

Feel free to add solutions in your preffered language, I for one am tackling all problems in javascript first and will eventually come back and try to tackle solution in Python but for now I will work on populating these solutions.

P.S I know Leetcode has a solution tab with explanations and people post their solutions in their preffered language but there are times we are limited on how many solutions we are allowed to see per day. I do not believe that information like that should be limited especially for people who are trying to break into the industry.

Thanks all and keep coding!!
